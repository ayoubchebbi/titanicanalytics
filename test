I've identified an issue where two Queueable jobs are being triggered at the same time, which is causing unexpected behavior. In this specific part of the Case process, I can confirm that one of the Queueables is present and being executed.

To address this, I'm required to refactor my code to avoid conflicts and ensure only one Queueable is triggered as expected.

Note: I also noticed other potential bugs in this area of the process.
It would be helpful if you could re-run the automated tests related to this flow to confirm that everything works properly.
