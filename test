login access has been granted to Salesforce Support for a few days; the affected Org ID is 00012938E8. The issue was working fine previously and started occurring afterward without any code changes, and it is related to a Portal Community with Guest User. I have added the portal link in the case description for your reference. Please let me know if you need any additional information. Best
