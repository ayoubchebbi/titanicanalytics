The two service appointments do not have the same address.
In the bundle configuration, the criteria are based on both patient and address.
Therefore, the bundling works correctly, and it is normal that the two appointments are not in the same bundle.
Sorry for not including screenshots, as I do not yet have access to the UAT environment.
