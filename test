Here's how you can structure your Jira ticket:

Jira Ticket: Bug in Validation Rule bblokvr

1. Description
As a user, I want the validation rule bblokvr to allow changes when the Work Order status is "Partially Complete" or "Cannot Complete," so that I can check the NoFurtherActionRequired__c field only in these cases.

2. Acceptance Criteria

When Work Order status is "Partially Complete" or "Cannot Complete", the NoFurtherActionRequired__c field can be checked.

When Work Order status is anything else, the NoFurtherActionRequired__c field cannot be checked.

Other operations should not be blocked by this validation rule.


3. Solution

Update the validation rule bblokvr to allow changes when Status is "Partially Complete" or "Cannot Complete".

Ensure the validation rule blocks the NoFurtherActionRequired__c field modification in all other cases.

Test different scenarios to confirm that the validation rule behaves as expected.
