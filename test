worked in the QA org without any issues, and I’m able to reproduce the behavior using the following elements:
Portal link:
https://airliquidehhc-emea-qa.sandbox.my.site.com/s/safe/lndaxs/s/?language=en_US&pId=MD4AOMVEMDAMMVUULEYSUF0
SA Number: SA-06137
Lightning link:

Organization ID: 00D0E000000HLLJ
I added access to this org accordingly.
Please let me know if you need any additional information.
Best regards,
