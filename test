🔧 Post-Deployment Step: Set Named Credential Identity Type to "Anonymous" in Salesforce UI

1. Go to Setup (click the gear icon ⚙️ at the top right, then click Setup).


2. In the Quick Find box, search for Named Credentials.


3. Click on Named Credentials.


4. Find and click on the Named Credential named Custom_Bundling_API.


5. Click Edit.


6. In the Authentication section, find the field Identity Type.


7. Set Identity Type to Anonymous from the dropdown.


8. Click Save.



> 🔒 If the Identity Type field is not editable (grayed out), it means the Named Credential was deployed via metadata. In that case, update the .namedCredential-meta.xml file and redeploy it via SFDX or your CI/CD tool.

Let me know if you want the metadata file template too.
