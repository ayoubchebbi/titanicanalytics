Description

After reviewing the data, I identified several issues that explain the observed behavior:

Two Service Appointments are not associated with any Service Territory.

The return-to-branch Service Appointment is marked as completed.

The Planned Tour has not been created.

Steps to Create a Planned Tour

2. Click on Create Planned Tour from the menu.


3. Provide the following information:

Schedule date

4. Click Create Planned Tour.


5. Check the Tour Order field on the related Service Appointments to confirm it has been populated.

Resolution

Added the missing Service Territory to the Service Appointments.

Created a new return-to-branch Service Appointment.

The scenario now works as expected.
