We are facing an error message on the Salesforce Experience Cloud (Community Portal) when attempting to reschedule a Service Appointment in Field Service.

The error indicates an issue related to a Permission Set on the Guest User.

We previously created a case regarding this issue, and we were advised to create or update Field Service Mobile Settings by disabling the notification setting.
This solution works correctly in other Salesforce orgs.

However, in our FR org, the issue still persists and the error message continues to appear.

Could you please help us:

Identify the root cause of this issue in the FR org

Explain why the same configuration works in other orgs but not in this one

Provide guidance on how to resolve this issue permanently

Thank you for your support.
