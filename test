Comment (Professional):

I retested the functionality on a few records, and the asset was successfully created in some cases. However, when clicking the "Create" button and during synchronization, the system displayed an error message. It's possible that this error is blocking the asset insertion process.

To further investigate the issue, here are a few potential areas to look into:

1. Error Message Details: Capture and analyze the exact error message displayed during synchronization. This may help identify whether it's a validation, permission, or integration issue.


2. Logs Review: Check server logs and debug logs (if applicable) around the time the error occurs. Look for any exceptions or failed transactions related to asset creation.


3. Record Comparison: Compare a successful and a failed record to identify any differences in data or related objects (e.g., required fields, ownership, or record type).


4. Validation Rules & Triggers: Review validation rules, process builders, flows, and triggers that may be conditionally preventing asset creation.


5. User Permissions: Confirm whether the user performing the action has the correct permissions to create assets, especially in relation to associated objects like Account, Product, or Case.


6. Network or Sync Issues: Investigate whether the issue could be related to network latency or a failed sync process, particularly if the system relies on API calls or external services.


7. Environment Differences: Check whether the issue is consistent across different environments (e.g., sandbox vs. production) to isolate configuration-related causes.
